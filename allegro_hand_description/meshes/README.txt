The .gltf/.bin files in this folder were originally converted from STL files
to OBJ files using the Open Asset Import Library (through
http://www.greentoken.de/onlineconv/) and then subsequently tweaked and
converted again to glTF; simply reconverting from source will not reproduce these
exact files. The input STL files came from the manufacturer (https://github.com
simlabrobotics/allegro_hand_ros/tree/master/allegro_hand_description/meshes).
The names of the meshes (including the .0 substrings) mirror the original
files as closely as possible to facilitate future mapping between STL and glTF
files.
