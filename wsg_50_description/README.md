# Schunk WSG50 Meshes

## Attribution 

All files under `./meshes` were created in CAD using Schunk's drawing
in the [product catalog](https://schunk.com/fileadmin/pim/docs/IM0026091.PDF) (WSG 050-110-P model). Please see `LICENSE` for more information.

Note that these models are not based off [Schunk's provided CAD model](https://schunk.partcommunity.com/3d-cad-models/wsg-electrical-2-finger-parallel-gripper-universal-gripper-schunk?info=schunk%2Fgreifsysteme_neu%2Fschunk_greifer_neu%2Fparallelgreifer_neu%2Fwsg_asm_at.prj&cwid=7511) due to [licensing problems with CADENAS](https://www.cadenas.de/terms-of-use-3d-cad-models).

The `.obj` files were converted in Blender from `.stl` files, which were
exported from Solidworks using the CAD files.

## Disclaimer 

As this is only based on Schunk's drawing files (not the CAD file), the dimensions of the model are accurate only up to the published dimensions in the drawing. Some details such as hole dimensions may not be entirely accurate.
