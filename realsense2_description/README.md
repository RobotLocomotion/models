# Intel RealSense cameras

This folder contains models of the Intel RealSense cameras.

The models were originally published by Intel here
 https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros
but have been further customized for use by Drake, e.g., changing the
mesh paths and mesh file formats.

Drake's models are based on v4.54.1 from the Intel repository.
