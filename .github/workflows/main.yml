      # In the below: `github.ref` will be either "refs/pull/<pr_number>/merge"
      # or "refs/heads/master"; `github.run_number` is a monotonically increasing
      # serial number; and `github.run_attempt` is a typically 1.
      #
      # The `key` declared here will never match (since it encodes the current
      # run_number) but illustrates the name we'll use to save the caches when
      # we're done.
      #
      # However, one of the `restore-keys` patterns *should* always match. The
      # effects we should see from the `restore-keys` patterns are:
      #
      # * When building the `master` branch, we'll always pull the most recently
      #   updated master caches. Both restore keys say
      #   "bazel_ci-refs/heads/master-" and the prior archives are named, e.g.,
      #   "bazel_ci-refs/heads/master-####-#".  GitHub will use the *most
      #   recently saved* archive name that matches the restore key prefix
      #   (no matter the lexicographic ordering of the ####-# part).
      #
      # * Ditto for the first build of a PR; the first restore key will not
      #   match anything, so it falls back to the master caches.
      #
      # * For subsequent builds of a PR, the first restore key, e.g.,
      #   "bazel_ci-refs/pull/###/merge-" should match the most recently saved
      #   PR key "bazel_ci-refs/pull/###/merge-####-#".
