# Atlas

Note that this model is completely untextured. In the git history of
this repository, there are some color texture images at
atlas/materials/textures/... that could be resurrected if needed.

TODO(jwnimmer-tri) Most likely, the `foo_chull` meshes could be replaced by the
likewise `foo` objects marked as `drake:declare_convex`.
