# YCB Objects

This incorporates a subset of the YCB Models.

## Attribution

All files under `./meshes` attributed to the
[The YCP Object and Model Set](http://ycb-benchmarks.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/). Please see
`./meshes/LICENSE.txt` for more information.

The original objects were downloaded on 2019-02-04 via
`./download_originals.py`.

## Modifications

The `.mtl` and `*.obj` files were modified to reflect file renames, then
converted to gltf using `obj2gltf`, then amended to use `*.ktx2` textures.

### Sugar box

The `004_sugar_box_textured.obj` (and its associated `*.mtl` file) are kept
around in support of obj-specific tutorials and unit tests inside Drake; it is
not used by any of our SDFormat files.

## Scope

This contains a small subset of objects from the YCB dataset for use with
Manipulation Station demos in Drake. See
[this discussion](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/issues/10024#issuecomment-458727931)
for more information about the scope.
